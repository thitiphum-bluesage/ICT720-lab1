## User Stories
- **As a homeowner:** I want to easily check the current temperature and humidity in my home through a simple web page, so that I can understand my home's climate without needing technical knowledge about the sensors or data collection methods.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. The system displays real-time temperature and humidity data on a web interface.
     2. Information updates automatically, reflecting the latest sensor readings.
     3. The interface provides an option to view a summary of daily climate trends.

- **As a homeowner:** I want to receive an estimate of how long it will take to reach my preferred temperature if I turn on the air conditioner now, so that I can make informed decisions about the best time to adjust my AC settings for comfort and efficiency.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. Users can input or select their current indoor temperature and desired comfort level through the web interface.
     2. The system provides a clear estimate of how long it will take to cool the room to the desired temperature.
     3. Predictions consider historical temperature and humidity data to improve accuracy.

- **As a homeowner:** I want to be alerted if my air conditioner has been running for an extended period, such as more than 8 hours, so that I can make conscious decisions about energy use and possibly adjust settings to prevent unnecessary operation.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. The system monitors air conditioner runtime and automatically alerts the user if it exceeds the set threshold (e.g., 8 hours).
     2. Users receive a user-friendly reminder or alert, suggesting they check if continued AC operation is necessary.
     3. Users have options to acknowledge the alert, snooze it for a certain period, or adjust settings directly if the interface supports it.
